Sign Tone: Deaf Companion System for Two-Way Communication between Deaf and Non-Deaf Individuals
Sign language recognition is a typical application of hand gesture recognition. It is often considered that only deaf people rely on sign languages for conveying their thoughts. However, particular medical problems such as down syndrome, autism, cerebral palsy, trauma, and brain diseases or speech difficulties may require a nonverbal mode of communication. 6,909 spoken languages and 138 sign languages have been identified, but there is no universal sign language. Each has its own syntactical and grammatical structures to provide definitive means of communication, primarily for deaf communities worldwide. Sign languages emphasize on the movement of the hands, arms, head, and body in a conceptually predetermined manner to significantly construct a gesture language
