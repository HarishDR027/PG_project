Sign Tone: Deaf Companion System for Two-Way Communication between Deaf and Non-Deaf Individuals.

Sign language recognition is a typical application of hand gesture recognition. It is often considered that only deaf people rely on sign languages for conveying their thoughts. However, particular medical problems such as down syndrome, autism, cerebral palsy, trauma, and brain diseases or speech difficulties may require a nonverbal mode of communication. 6,909 spoken languages and 138 sign languages have been identified, but there is no universal sign language. Each has its own syntactical and grammatical structures to provide definitive means of communication, primarily for deaf communities worldwide. Sign languages emphasize on the movement of the hands, arms, head, and body in a conceptually predetermined manner to significantly construct a gesture language

# SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The scope of the project encompasses the following key areas:

•	Sign Language Recognition Module (SRM)
Designing and implementing a robust SignNet Model based on Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for accurate recognition and interpretation of sign language gestures. Training the SignNet Model on a representative dataset, with a focus on the cultural nuances of the Indian Sign Language.

•	Speech Recognition and Synthesis Module (SRSM)
Implementing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based speech recognition system to convert spoken language from non-deaf individuals into text. Developing a synthesis module to process the text and generate corresponding sign language gestures.

•	Avatar Module (AM)
Creating an Avatar Module capable of generating realistic and culturally sensitive sign language avatars aligned with the converted text from non-deaf speech.

•	Integration into Deaf Companion System
Integrating the Sign Language Recognition Module, Speech Recognition and Synthesis Module, and Avatar Module into a unified Deaf Companion System. Ensuring seamless operation to facilitate effective communication between deaf individuals and non-deaf individuals, accommodating varying communication needs.

•	Web-Based User Interface
Designing and implementing an accessible and user-friendly web-based interface to deploy the SignNet Model and the entire Deaf Companion System. Prioritizing an intuitive interface that caters to the diverse needs of both deaf and non-deaf users.

•	Commercial Scalability
Investigating opportunities for commercial scalability, exploring potential partnerships and collaborations to make the Deaf Companion System widely accessible. Considering adaptability for diverse environments and user groups to ensure scalability.
